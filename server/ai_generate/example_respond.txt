    ## Learning Assembly Language: A Simple Guide

    ## Flags: Programming, Low-Level, Systems Programming

    ## Introduction

    Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides a direct interface to a computer's hardware. Unlike high-level languages like Python or JavaScript, assembly language uses mnemonics (short codes) to represent instructions that the CPU can understand. While it might seem complex, learning assembly can offer valuable insights into how computers function and can be useful for tasks like optimizing code, creating device drivers, or even understanding malware.
